# Feelings
## Surreal
## Fear
Fear is created by a lack of sounds and little ambience.
Lighting is used to induce the feeling of fear as lights flicker on and off and areas are generally at a low light level.
Forcing the player to turn around and possibly face something frightening adds tension.

## Discomfort
Baby crying gives the player a sense of discomfort especially given the already bad circumstances.
The mascot model appearing with multiple limbs gives the feeling of discomfort as that isn't what it should look like.
## Anxiety
Player is given instructions which they are forced to not obey as they are avoiding responsibility.
# Gameplay
Initial introduction of the game is it pretending to crash, giving a small sense of what's to come.
Small jumpscare to create a sense of tension during a slow section, makes the player expectant of more in the near future which is generally used to then build up tension.
Doors not working force the player to turn around, which in media has become a staple in horror as the viewer doesn't know what could be behind them/the character, this expectation is somewhat subverted by nothing happening immediately, but the corridor appears to then continue backwards.
The poster mascot is then shown with an inanimate 3D model, giving a real object to project fear from.
Increase in the posters on the wall gives us more insight into the character we are playing and how the company has warped their perception of the world.

# Visuals
## Style
## Colour
Distinct use of reds and blacks, giving a uniform colour format.
## Assets
Company posters along the walls everywhere, giving the player some context for the environment they are in, as well as a recognizable mascot.
Mascot becomes distorted and appears with multiple limbs, this works with the distorted sound to instill more discomfort in the player.
## Lighting
Low lighting is generally used, but areas are still lit well enough to see everything.
Flickering lights give off an uneasy feeling that things aren't working as they should and darkness invokes a sense of fear.

# Sound
## Music
No music and limited ambience during intro gameplay, making the experience more tense.
Distorted music starts giving more insight into the characters mental state and how everything seems wrong somehow, the beeping and alarms have stopped but now the music gives the perception that things still aren't okay.
## Effects
Emergency effect makes the player feel like they are doing something wrong but have to continue. Loud snappy effects to make the player jumpy.
Heavy boot sound effects on metal flooring.
Baby crying in the background gives the sense of fear and discomfort, and is used as foreshadowing as later scenes include the mentions/visuals of a baby in bad circumstances.
Loud alarm giving a sense of urgency.
# Characters
## Design
The way we are introduced to the characters is a group meeting where they all seem to have distinct outlooks on the situation and life.
## Individuals
### Anya

### Swansea
Cares about doing things right, by the book, wants money.
### Daisuke
Positive outlook, optimistic, somewhat comedic relief
### Jimmy
